# Changelog

All notable changes to ViTransfer-TVP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **24-hour time picker** for key dates — clock-style HH→MM selector with 5-minute increments, defaults to 12:00 when opened empty, replaces previous long-dropdown style for Start/Finish/Reminder times in all Add Key Date modals
- **Automated setup scripts** — `setup.sh` (Linux/Mac/WSL) and `setup.ps1` (Windows PowerShell) auto-generate all 6 required secrets, validate admin credentials, port, timezone, and HTTPS configuration

### Changed
- **Video upload resume** — check video status before resuming from localStorage to prevent invalid resume attempts when video moved past UPLOADING phase
- **Sales line item layout** — tightened invoice/quote line item grid layout with improved responsive behavior for tax rate and subtotal fields
- **Share album download buttons** — changed to primary button style (from outline) for better visual prominence in album viewer
- **Docker workflow** — simplified to use `docker-compose.override.yml` pattern (gitignored) for local builds instead of separate build compose file
- Date validation error messages now show "Invalid date value. Please use the date picker." instead of locale-specific "date must be YYYY-MM-DD" format text
- Date input fields now enforce 4-digit year bounds (0001–9999) via `min`/`max` attributes to prevent entering invalid year values
- Updated all branch references from `dev` to `main` in installation documentation

### Fixed
- **Client name changes not reflected in project dashboard** — renaming a client now automatically syncs all linked projects' display names; dashboard now includes live client relation as fallback ensuring current names always display
- **413 error for video uploads over 1GB** — video/asset uploads now correctly skip `maxUploadSizeGB` limit in TUS upload handler
- **Video re-upload to ERROR status** — allow re-uploading to videos that previously failed by resetting state to UPLOADING
- Date picker calendar icon now visible in dark mode with proper contrast (inverted and brightened) across all themes
- Date picker icon globally styled in `globals.css` ensuring consistent visibility on all date input fields

### Removed
- `compose-up.ps1` helper script (standard `docker compose up -d` now works for both pull and build workflows)
- `docker-compose.build.yml` (replaced by optional `docker-compose.override.yml` pattern)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- Merged `scripts/retry-publish-docker.ps1` into `publish-docker.ps1` — retry loop, DNS pre-check, and post-publish verification are now built in
- Added `-MaxAttempts`, `-RetrySleep`, `-NoRetry`, and `-NoVerify` flags to `publish-docker.ps1`

### Removed
- `scripts/retry-publish-docker.ps1` (no longer needed)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-15

First independent release of ViTransfer-TVP as a hard fork.
Forked from upstream ViTransfer v0.8.2 (archived at `archive/upstream-v0.8.2` branch).

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-07

### Changed
- IP and domain blocklists moved into Security Settings with dedicated management UI, inline add/remove, and loading states; Security Events page now focuses on event history and rate limits only
- Rate limit controls refreshed automatically on load and lay out responsively alongside filters and actions

### Fixed
- Admin project view now updates comments immediately when new comments are posted, avoiding stale threads until the next full refresh
- Hotlink blocklist forms stack cleanly on mobile and include clearer lock expiration messaging in rate limit details

## [0.6.9] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed
- OTP-only projects now correctly display name selection dropdown in comment section
- Recipients API now returns data for all authenticated modes (PASSWORD, OTP, BOTH, NONE), not just password-protected projects
- Security dashboard blocklist forms no longer overflow on mobile devices
- Blocklist item text (IP addresses and domains) now wraps properly on small screens

### Changed
- Removed admin session detection from public share page for cleaner code separation
- Public share page now treats all users (including admins) as clients - admins should use dedicated admin share page
- Made `adminUser` parameter optional in comment management hook for better backwards compatibility
- Improved responsive layout for security blocklist UI (stacks vertically on mobile, horizontal on desktop)

### Technical
- Updated share API route to include recipients for all non-guest authenticated users
- Added `flex-col sm:flex-row` responsive classes to blocklist forms
- Added `min-w-0`, `break-all`, and `break-words` classes to prevent text overflow in blocklist items

## [0.6.7] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- Security dashboard overhaul with event tracking, rate-limit visibility/unblock, and IP/domain blocklists (UI + APIs). Migration: `20251206000000_add_ip_domain_blocklists`.
- Share auth logging: successful password and guest access now generate security events.
- Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Space toggles play/pause even while typing comments.
- FPS now shown in admin video metadata; video list displays custom version labels when available.

### Changed
- Standardized security event labels across admin/share auth (password, OTP, guest, passkey); clear existing security events after upgrading to avoid mixed legacy labels in the dashboard.
- Timecode: full drop-frame support (29.97/59.94) with `HH:MM:SS;FF` parsing/formatting; format hints repositioned and aligned with timecode display; DF/NDF badge removed in favor of contextual hint; format hint sits above the timecode.
- Comment UX: auto-pause video when typing comments; added format hint sizing tweaks; version label shown instead of raw version number in lists.

- Bind fallback share tokens to the correct session and reduce token churn on share pages to avoid unexpected access denials.
- Preserve custom thumbnail assets during reprocess and when deleting older versions so copied thumbnails stay valid; keep shared thumbnail files intact when deleting a video if other assets or videos still reference the same storage path.
- Allow admins to download original files via the content endpoint even before approval; admin panel downloads avoid popups and stay responsive.
- Exclude admin activity from analytics and tag admin download sessions to keep metrics clean.
