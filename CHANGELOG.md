## [0.2.5] - 2025-11-11

> **⚠️ TRANSITIONAL RELEASE:** This version removes the old notification system to prepare for the new configurable notification summary system coming in v0.3.0. Client reply notifications are temporarily disabled - clients must check the share page manually for admin responses. This is intentional and temporary as we build towards a better notification experience.

### Added
- Sort toggle for projects dashboard (status/alphabetical sorting)
- Sort toggle for project videos and versions (status/alphabetical sorting)
- Section dividers in share page sidebar (For Review / Approved sections)
- Green check mark icon for approved videos in sidebar (replaces play icon)
- New `formatDate()` utility for consistent date formatting (11-Nov-2025 format)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: All comments must now be video-specific (general comments removed)
- **BREAKING**: Client reply notifications temporarily disabled (preparing for v0.3.0 summary notifications)
- **BREAKING**: Removed per-comment email notification opt-in checkbox
- Admin new comment notifications still working (unchanged)
- Share page sorting now checks if ANY version is approved (not just latest)
- Video groups in admin panel sorted by approval status (unapproved first)
- Versions within groups sorted by approval status (approved first)
- Projects list extracted to client component for better performance
- README development warning now includes 3-2-1 backup principle
- All recipient IDs migrated from UUID to CUID format for consistency
- All dates now display in consistent "11-Nov-2025" format

### Removed
- General/system comments (all comments must be attached to a video)
- Email notification checkbox from comment form
- `notifyByEmail` and `notificationEmail` fields from Comment model
- `flexibleIdSchema` workaround from validation (now using cuidSchema only)
- System audit comments for approval/unapproval actions (status tracked in database)

### Improved
- Approved badge spacing in admin panel
- "All Versions" section spacing from content above
- Analytics projects card spacing to prevent overlap
- Version labels padding to prevent hover animation cutoff
- Mobile inline editing no longer overflows with action buttons

### Fixed
- Projects dashboard now loads correctly after refactoring
- Mobile overflow when editing video/group names
- Version label hover animation cutoff at top of container

### Database Migration
